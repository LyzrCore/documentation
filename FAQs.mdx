## What is Lyzr?

Lyzr is an agentic framework that allows builders develop generative AI applications with intrinsic Safe and Responsible AI features that ensure accuracy and security. Lyzr provides a no code agent building platform, [Studio](https://studio.lyzr.ai/), allowing anybody to easily create enterprise ready agents with options to include RAG, Text2SQL and to use a wide array of tools. In addition, all of these capabilities are available as APIs to allow developers to easily utilize these agents in their applications.

## Who should use Lyzr?

Lyzr is designed for Developers, CTOs, CPOs, and CIOs who value simplicity, rapid deployment, and data privacy in developing generative AI applications. It is particularly beneficial for those looking to integrate AI features in-house with a minimal learning curve.

## What types of applications can be built with Lyzr?

With Lyzr, users can build chatbots, knowledge search engines, data analysis tools, RAG-powered applications, and multi-agent workflow automation. It also supports advanced uses like QA bots for FAQs and Text-to-SQL for database analysis.

## What are some key features of Lyzr's agent framework?

Key features include Studio - the no code agent building platform, Safe and Responsible AI features like PII redaction, prompt injection detection and reflection, APIs and an AI Management System (AIMS).

## How does Lyzr ensure Enterprise readiness?

The Lyzr architecture incorporates Safe and Responsible AI features such as PII redaction, prompt injection detection, reflection and groundedness which ensures that any agent that is built automatically adheres to these policies. In addition, Lyzr's services such as the agent service, RAG and tools are highly available and built for scale, allowing developers to confidently build their uses cases with Lyzr's agents without worrying about latency or downtime.

## Can Lyzr be compared to other generative AI app-building platforms?

Yes, Lyzr is often compared to platforms like Langchain, DSPy, and LlamaIndex. While these platforms use building blocks, programmatic, and modular approaches respectively, Lyzr uses an "agentic" approach that focuses on fully integrated and configurable agents.
