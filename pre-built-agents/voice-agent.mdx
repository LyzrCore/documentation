The VoiceBot open-source software (OSS) module is a versatile tool that utilizes OpenAI's powerful APIs to perform text-to-speech conversion, audio transcription, and text summarization into structured notes. Here's how you can harness each of these functionalities in your OSS applications:

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert texts into spoken words using various voices provided by OpenAI TTS.
- **Transcribe**: Transcribe spoken words into text using Whisper API.
- **Text-to-Notes**: Turn conversations into organized bullet points, ensuring no detail is omitted.

## Usage

lets start by making an object of the module first

```python
from lyzr import VoiceBot
vb = VoiceBot(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

### Text-to-Speech

```python
text = "Text you want converted into audio"
vb.text_to_speech(text)
    # ... (Online OpenAI API call to convert text to speech) ...
    # The TTS wil be saved as tts_output.mp3 in the directory it was called in
```

### Transcription (Speech to Text)

```python
audiofilepath = "path/to/audio/file"
transcript = vb.transcribe(audiofilepath)
    # ... (Online API call or local synthesis to transcribe audio content to text) ...
    # Returns the text transcription of the audio
print(transcript)
```

### Text-to-Notes

```python
text = "Big paragraphs or conversations that you wish to streamline or shorten"
notes = vb.text_to_notes(text)
    # ... (Online API call to GPT for summarization as bullet points) ...
    # Returns structured notes
print(notes)
```
These functions make it simple to integrate advanced linguistic and speech capabilities into your applications, allowing you to create new user experiences or enhance existing workflows. Use the VoiceBot module to effectively manage content generation, comprehension, and accessibility tasks.

## Limitations

- The open-source version requires an internet connection to utilize the online API.
- It offers a smaller subset of features compared to enterprise versions, focusing primarily on cloud-based services.
