DataAnalyzr is a conversational analytics framework that provides access to LLM-integrated advanced data analysis through a conversational interface to derive actionable insights and intuitive visualizations.
Given a dataset, it allows you to ask questions and get responses, all in plain English.

Behind the scenes, DataAnalyzr uses LLMs to generate code, which is used to analyze the given data and produce results.
The framework is designed for ease of use, enabling users with little programming experience to access complex data analysis tools.
This makes it an invaluable tool for businesses seeking to leverage data-driven insights for decision-making.
