The Lyzr Agent API is a versatile and modular framework designed for developing role-based agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables the creation of both **chat** applications and **task** automation systems, allowing agents to either engage in real-time conversations or execute complex, multi-step processes. With three core components—**Environment**, **Agent**, and **Inference**—developers can easily define, configure, and manage agents suited to various use cases. Whether building chatbots or automating tasks, Lyzr Agent API streamlines the development of intelligent, role-driven solutions for diverse applications.

<Note>
Note: Lyzr agents can be orchestrated with Lao (Lyzr Agent Orchestrator) as part of Lyzr AgentMesh.

| Component   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Environment | Defines the modules, features, and available tools, and configures the overall operational space for the agent. This ensures the agent has the right tools and context to operate. |
| Agent       | Configures the agent, including its system prompt, name, and persona. The agent is linked to an environment and operates within its defined parameters. |
| Chat        | Facilitates real-time conversational interactions with the agent. |
| Task        | Manages and executes long-running tasks, making the agent capable of handling more complex, sustained processes. |
