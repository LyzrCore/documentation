description: Vector store structure and operations in DataAnalyzr
---

The vector store is an attribute of DataAnalyzr that allows storage and retrieval of details about input datasets and past query-response pairs.
This information is a key component of the response generation flow in DataAnalyzr.
It allows the system to understand the context of the query, generate and accurate responses, and get smarter with use.

In this guide, we will discuss the structure of the vector store, the types of information it stores, and the operations that can be performed on it.

## Structure

The information in the vector store is divided into five collections - Documentation, DDL, SQL, Python, and Plot.
Each collection stores a specific type of information and is used for different purposes.

They are also populated at different stages of the analysis process:
1. The Documentation collection is filled at the time of data ingestion,
2. The DDL collection is empty by default and left to the user to fill (if needed), and 
3. The SQL, Python and Plot collections are filled during analysis.

### Documentation collection

The documentation collection contains the following information about each of the input datasets:
1. Column names, data types, and number or fraction of null values.
2. A snapshot of the dataset - the first five rows.

For example, for **SQL-based analysis** and a SQLite dataset with a table called `population`, the dataset details would include the following two sections:
<CodeGroup>
```markdown columns' information
The following columns are in the population table:

|    | name               | type   |
|---:|:-------------------|:-------|
|  0 | country            | TEXT   |
|  1 | population_in_2022 | REAL   |
|  2 | population_in_2023 | REAL   |
|  3 | region             | TEXT   |
|  4 | sub_region         | TEXT   |
```
```markdown snapshot
Following are the first five rows of the population table:

| country       |   population_in_2022 |   population_in_2023 | region   | sub_region         |
|:--------------|---------------------:|---------------------:|:---------|:-------------------|
| India         |        1417173173.00 |        1428627663.00 | Asia     | Southern Asia      |
| China         |        1425887337.00 |        1425671352.00 | Asia     | Eastern Asia       |
| United States |         338289857.00 |         339996564.00 | Americas | Northern America   |
| Indonesia     |         275501339.00 |         277534123.00 | Asia     | South-eastern Asia |
| Pakistan      |         235824862.00 |         240485658.00 | Asia     | Southern Asia      |
```
</CodeGroup>

Similarly, for **Pythonic analysis** and a pandas DataFrame called `real_estate`, the dataset details would include the following two sections:
<CodeGroup>
```markdown columns' information
The following columns are in the real_estate dataframe:

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 414 entries, 0 to 413
Data columns (total 8 columns):

```

### DDL collection

Data Definition Language (DDL) examples are SQL queries that define the structure of a table.
These are relevant for SQL-based analysis only.

The DDL collection includes:
1. The SQL query used to create the table.
2. The SQL query used to insert data into the table.


By default, this collection is empty.

An example of a DDL query for a table called `population` is as follows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE population (
    Country TEXT,
    "Population in 2022" REAL,
    "Population in 2023" REAL,
    Region TEXT,
    "Sub Region" TEXT
);
```

### SQL collection

The SQL collection includes examples of SQL queries that have been generated during analysis in response to user input.
They are used as examples to answer similar questions in the future.
These examples are relevant only for SQL-based analysis and are only added if the SQL query executes successfully.

Each such example includes:
1. Input question.
2. SQL query generated during analysis.


For example, for an input question about the population of a specific country, the input question and SQL query pair could be as follows:

```python
question = "How did the population of India change over the years?"
sql = """
SELECT 
    Country, 
    "Population in 2022", 
    "Population in 2023" 
FROM 
    population 
WHERE 
    Country = 'India';
"""
```

### Python collection

The Python collection includes examples of Python code that have been generated during analysis in response to user input.
They are used as examples to answer similar questions in the future.
These examples are relevant only for Pythonic analysis and are only added if the code executes successfully.

Each of these examples includes:
1. Input question.
2. Python code snippet generated during analysis.

For example, for a pandas DataFrame called `real_estate`, the input question and Python code pair could be as follows:

```python
question = "How does the price vary with number of convenience stores?"
code = """
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Data Cleaning: Ensure there are no missing values
real_estate = real_estate.dropna()

# Feature Selection
X = real_estate[['number_of_convenience_stores']]
y = real_estate['house_price_of_unit_area']

# Add a constant to the model (intercept)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Get the summary of the model
result = model.summary2().tables[1]
"""
```

### Plot collection

The plot collection includes code that has been used to generate visualisations in response to user input.
They are used as examples to generate similar visualisations in the future.
These examples are relevant for both SQL and Pythonic analysis and are only added if the code executes successfully.

Each of these examples includes:
1. Input question.
2. Plotting code snippet generated during analysis.

For example, for **SQL-based analysis** and a connection to the database `conn` with table `population`, the input question and plotting code pair could be as follows:

```python
question = "How did the population of India change over the years?"
code = """
# Query the database
query = '''
SELECT country, population_in_2022, population_in_2023, 
       (population_in_2023 - population_in_2022) AS population_change
FROM population
WHERE country = 'India';
'''
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn.conn)

# Prepare data for plotting
years = ['2022', '2023']
population = [df['population_in_2022'].values[0], df['population_in_2023'].values[0]]

# Create the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(years, population, marker='o')
ax.set_title('Population Change in India (2022-2023)')
ax.set_xlabel('Year')
ax.set_ylabel('Population')
ax.grid(True)
"""
```

Similarly, for **Pythonic analysis** and a pandas DataFrame called `real_estate`, the input question and plotting code pair could be as follows:
```python
question = "How does the price vary with number of convenience stores?"
code = """
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=real_estate, x='number_of_convenience_stores', y='house_price_of_unit_area', ax=ax)
ax.set_title('House Price vs Number of Convenience Stores')
ax.set_xlabel('Number of Convenience Stores')
ax.set_ylabel('House Price of Unit Area')
"""
```

## Operations

The information in the vector store can be augmented and retrieved using a set of operations.
By adding extra information to the vector store, you can improve the quality of responses generated by DataAnalyzr.

This is especially useful in the following scenarios:
1. The system has difficulty intuiting the information in your dataset (e.g. when the column names are not descriptive).
2. Your dataset pertains to a specific domain and you want to improve the system's understanding of that domain.
3. You want to change the way in which the system responds to a specific type of query.
4. You want to encourage the system to generate specific types of responses.
5. For overall performance improvement.

In the following sections, we will discuss how to add information to the vector store and how to retrieve information from it.
We will assume that an instance of DataAnalyzr has been created and is available as `data_analyzr`.
The following attributes are then available:
1. [Vector Store](/pre-built-agents/data-analyzr/advanced-configuration/vector-store.mdx): `data_analyzr.vector_store`
2. [Documentation Collection](#documentation-collection): `data_analyzr.vector_store.documentation_collection`
3. [DDL Collection](#ddl-collection): `data_analyzr.vector_store.ddl_collection`
4. [SQL Collection](#sql-collection): `data_analyzr.vector_store.sql_collection`
5. [Python Collection](#python-collection): `data_analyzr.vector_store.python_collection`
6. [Plot Collection](#plot-collection): `data_analyzr.vector_store.plot_collection`


### Adding information

To add information to the vector store, follow these simple steps:
1. Identify the type of information you want to add - documentation, DDL, SQL, Python, or plot - and, correspondingly, the collection you want to add it to.
2. Ensure that the information is in the format of a python string.
3. Use the `add_training_data` method of the vector store to add the information to the relevant collection.

<CodeGroup>
```python documentation
documentation = "Your documentation string here"
data_analyzr.vector_store.add_training_data(documentation=documentation)
```

```python ddl
ddl = "Your DDL string here"
data_analyzr.vector_store.add_training_data(ddl=ddl)
```

```python sql
question = "Your question string here"
sql = "Your SQL string here"
data_analyzr.vector_store.add_training_data(question=question, sql=sql)
```

```python python
question = "Your question string here"
python_code = "Your Python code string here"
data_analyzr.vector_store.add_training_data(question=question, python_code=python_code)
```

```python plot
question = "Your question string here"
plot_code = "Your plotting code string here"
data_analyzr.vector_store.add_training_data(question=question, plot_code=plot_code)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Retrieval

Information retrival from the vector store depends on the use case.

#### Retrieving relevant information

To retrieve information relevant to a specific query, the following methods are available:
1. Documentation: `get_related_documentation`
2. DDL: `get_related_ddl`
3. SQL: `get_related_sql_queries`
4. Python: `get_related_python_code`
5. Plot: `get_related_plotting_code`

Each of these methods takes the query as input and returns the most relevant information as a python list.

<CodeGroup>
```python documentation
# Retrieve relevant documentation for a query
query = "Your query string here"
relevant_documentation = data_analyzr.vector_store.get_related_documentation(query)
```

```python ddl
# Retrieve relevant DDL for a query
query = "Your query string here"
relevant_ddl = data_analyzr.vector_store.get_related_ddl(query)
```

```python sql
# Retrieve relevant SQL queries for a query
query = "Your query string here"
relevant_sql = data_analyzr.vector_store.get_related_sql_queries(query)
```

```python python
# Retrieve relevant Python code for a query
query = "Your query string here"
relevant_python = data_analyzr.vector_store.get_related_python_code(query)
```

```python plot
# Retrieve relevant plotting code for a query
query = "Your query string here"
relevant_plot = data_analyzr.vector_store.get_related_plotting_code(query)
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Retrieving all information

To retrieve all the information in a collection, use the `get` method on the collection. The returned keys include `ids`, `embeddings`, `metadatas`, `documents`, `uris`, and `data`.

The `ids` key contains the unique identifiers of the stored information, while the `documents` key contains the actual information.

<CodeGroup>
```python documentation
# Retrieve all the information in the documentation collection
documentation = data_analyzr.vector_store.documentation_collection.get()

# Print each document along with its ID
for id, doc in zip(documentation['ids'], documentation['documents']):
    print(f"ID: {id}\n{doc}\n\n")
```
    
```python ddl
# Retrieve all the information in the DDL collection
ddl = data_analyzr.vector_store.ddl_collection.get()

# Print each document along with its ID
for id, doc in zip(ddl['ids'], ddl['documents']):
    print(f"ID: {id}\n{doc}\n\n")
```

```python sql
# Retrieve all the information in the SQL collection
sql = data_analyzr.vector_store.sql_collection.get()

# Print each document along with its ID
for id, doc in zip(sql['ids'], sql['documents']):
    print(f"ID: {id}\n{doc}\n\n")
```

```python python
# Retrieve all the information in the Python collection
python = data_analyzr.vector_store.python_collection.get()

# Print each document along with its ID
for id, doc in zip(python['ids'], python['documents']):
    print(f"ID: {id}\n{doc}\n\n")
```

```python plot
# Retrieve all the information in the Plot collection
plot = data_analyzr.vector_store.plot_collection.get()

# Print each document along with its ID
for id, doc in zip(plot['ids'], plot['documents']):
    print(f"ID: {id}\n{doc}\n\n")
```
</CodeGroup>
