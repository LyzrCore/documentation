## Lyzr + Weaviate Vector Database

Weaviate is a vector search engine that enables scalable and efficient vector searches. You can integrate Weaviate into your Lyzr application for both local embedded scenarios and cloud or self-hosted solutions.

### Local Embedded

```python
vector_store_params = {
    "vector_store_type": "WeaviateVectorStore",
    "index_name": "LyzrCore", 
}
```

### Cloud / Self Hosted

```bash
pip install weaviate-client
```

```python
import weaviate

resource_owner_config = weaviate.AuthClientPassword(
    username="<username>",
    password="<password>",
)

client = weaviate.Client(
    "https://lyzr-core.weaviate.network",
    auth_client_secret=resource_owner_config,
)

vector_store_params = {
    "vector_store_type": "WeaviateVectorStore",
    "weaviate_client": client,
    "api_key": "DB_API_KEY",
    "index_name": "LyzrCore",  
}
```
