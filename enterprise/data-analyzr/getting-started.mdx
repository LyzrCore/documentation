This document explains how to interact with the DataAnalyzr API using Python scripts.
This API is served at 

```http
https://v1.api.data-analyzr.dev.app.lyzr.ai/v1/
```


## Prerequisites

To use the DataAnalyzr API, you will need the following:

1. An API key provided by Lyzr's technical team.
2. A dataset that you want to ask questions on, and, if applicable, credentials that allow access to it.
3. A system from where you intend to access the API endpoints. For example, for Python, you will need a virtual environment with the `requests` library.

## Authentication

To use the DataAnalyzr Enterprise API endpoints, you must authenticate by providing a valid key in the Authorization header of your request.
The key should be provided in the following format:

```python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}
requests.post('url-of-the-api-endpoint', headers=headers)
```

## API Endpoints

The DataAnalyzr API provides two types of endpoints - analysis generation and vector store management.
For details on these API endpoints and how to use them, visit the [API Endpoints](enterprise/data-analyzr/endpoints) section.
1. **[Analysis generation endpoints](/enterprise/data-analyzr/api-endpoints#analysis-generation)**: These are the primary endpoints to get responses to your questions.
2. **[Vector store management](/enterprise/data-analyzr/api-endpoints#vector-store-management)**: Use these endpoints to add examples and extra information to your vector store.

## Troubleshooting and Support

If you encounter any issues while using the DataAnalyzr API, follow the troubleshooting steps below:
1. Validate your data source: Make sure you've entered accurate credentials and that the data source is online and accessible.
2. Validate your API tokens: Ensure that you've entered the correct API key - for the DataAnalyzr API, any LLMs you may be using, and any other services you're using.
3. Check with default parameters: If you're using any custom parameters, switch the default parameters to see if the issue is with your custom parameters.
If the default parameters work, ensure that your custom parameters are correct and the services are accessible.
For example, if you're using a custom LLM, connect to the LLM API directly to ensure that it is responding as expected.
Similarly, if you're using a custom s3 bucket, ensure that you are able to connect and add files to it using the AWS Python SDK.
4. Replicate with OSS: When possible, try to replicate your issue with the OSS version of DataAnalyzr to see if the issue is with the API or your data.
In the OSS version, you can read the logs using this code:
    
    ```python
    from lyzr.base.logger import read_csv_log
    # read the logs from the csv file into a pandas dataframe
    df = read_csv_log("path/to/logs.csv")
    df.head()
    ```
5. Contact support: For additional support, enterprise users can reach out to Lyzrâ€™s technical team.
Please provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including the endpoint you're trying to access, the data you're sending, and any error messages you're receiving.
