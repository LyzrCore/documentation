- **query_wrapper_prompt** (`str`): An optional prompt that can enhance the relevance of search queries by wrapping them in a specific context related to the webpage content.
- **embed_model** (`Union[str, EmbedType]`): The embedding model used for processing and embedding the webpage's text content. Defaults to a standard model suitable for general web content.
- **llm_params** (`dict`): Parameters for integrating Large Language Models to augment content understanding and query processing capabilities.
