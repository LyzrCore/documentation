When an organization plan is purchased, the buyer automatically becomes the Org Owner. The Org Owner can add team members and assign one of the following roles:

Member – Can create, use, and collaborate on agents and knowledge bases.
Admin – Can add and remove team members, manage access, and oversee organization-wide settings. Does not have access to billing cycle, and cannot stop subscription. Can do everything that an Admin can do
Org Owner – Can do everything that an Admin can do. But has additional control over team, billing and subscriptions. Owner can remove any user, but owner cannot be removed by others.

## Collaboration & Sharing
* Any creator of an agent or knowledge base can share it with other members within the organization.
* Collaboration ensures seamless knowledge sharing and team-wide access to important resources.

Only one member of an organization can be an Org Owner. By default, the user who has subscribed and paid the Organization plan would be made the Owner
