## Usage

To start using Generator-Agent, first instantiate the Generator with an API key:

```python
from lyzr import Generator
generator = Generator(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

### Generate Elaborate Content

```python
text = "Prompt or idea that you want to expand upon"
instructions = "Short Story"  # Other options include "Poem", "Children's Story", "Tweet"
persona = "Not Specified"  # Tailors the content to a specific audience

elaborated_content = generator.generate(text, persona=persona, style=style)
print(elaborated_content)
```

This will generate content corresponding to the designated style and persona, offering flexibility and creativity in your writing tasks.

## Limitations

- RLHF is not available in the OSS version, potentially affecting the nuanced understanding and output quality of the generated content.
- Internet connectivity is required.

Generator-Agent empowers you to transform simple ideas into captivating stories, poems, essays, and tweets, perfect for content creators seeking a versatile and powerful writing assistant.
