## Lyzr + OpenAI Integration

Integrating OpenAI's models into Lyzr enables your applications to utilize the cutting-edge capabilities of models such as GPT-4. This integration requires specifying a set of parameters tailored to OpenAI's API, including the model name, your API key, and generation controls.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate OpenAI model for your needs. Models vary in size, capability, and cost. For example, "gpt-4-0125-preview" represents a version of GPT-4.

2. **API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI. This key is essential for authenticating your requests to the OpenAI API.

3. **Generation Parameters**: Configure generation parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` to control the model's output characteristics.

### Example Configuration

```python
llm_params = {
    "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview",
    "api_key": "sk-<YOUR-API-KEY>",
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 0,
}
```

- **temperature**: A low temperature (e.g., 0) results in more deterministic and less varied output.
- **top_p**: Setting `top_p` to 0 effectively selects the most probable outcomes, reducing randomness.
