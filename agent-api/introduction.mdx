The Lyzr Agent API is a versatile and modular framework designed to facilitate the development of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents. Its architecture is built around three core components: Environment, Agent, and Inference. Each of these components has specific endpoints that allow developers to define, configure, and manage agents tailored to various use cases. The framework is structured to streamline the process of creating interactive, task-based, and conversational agents, making it easier to build AI-driven solutions across different applications.

| Component   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Environment | Defines the modules, features, and available tools, and configures the overall operational space for the agent. This ensures the agent has the right tools and context to operate. |
| Agent       | Configures the agent, including its system prompt, name, and persona. The agent is linked to an environment and operates within its defined parameters. |
| Chat        | Facilitates real-time conversational interactions with the agent. |
| Task        | Manages and executes long-running tasks, making the agent capable of handling more complex, sustained processes. |
