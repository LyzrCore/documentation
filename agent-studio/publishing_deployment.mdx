The agent built can be deployed in 2 ways: 
- Publish it as part of app store of Agent Studio
- Deploy it as part of your own product

## Publishing in app store
1. Click Save Agent after testing.
2. Select Publish to make it accessible.
3. Define privacy settings
    - Private – will be published, but will be visible to the creator of the agent
    - Organization – will be published as part of organization, and will be visible to all the team members of the organization. Publishing to organization is only available to members who are part of the organization plan.
    - Public – will be visible to everyone as part of the Appstore
