# Summarizer-Agent Feature Comparison

Here's how the OSS version matches up against premium versions. It is important to note that the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is not included in the OSS version. 

| Feature             | Open Source Edition (OSE)            | Enterprise Edition (EE)              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Summary Generation  | GPT-4                       | Any LLM + Lyzr RLHF                |
| Style Customization | Summary, Notes, Tweet or text prompt  | Enhanced style customization options |
| Critical Information Focus | Yes                            | Yes                                  |

## Usage

Instantiating the Summarizer is straightforward:

```python
from lyzr import Summarizer
summarizer = Summarizer(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

### Generating Summaries

```python
text = "Big paragraphs or conversations that you wish to streamline or shorten"
style = "Summary"  # Other options include "Notes", "Tweet"

summary = summarizer.summarize(text, style=style)
print(summary)
```

This will result in a neatly condensed version of the text, catering to your selected style, and facilitating a faster understanding of the content's essence.

## Limitations

- The OSS version lacks RLHF, which may impact adaptability and refinement of the summaries.
- Internet connectivity is required.
