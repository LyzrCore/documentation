Lyzr Agent Studio is a no-code AI agent-building platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage AI-powered agents tailored to their business needs. This platform is designed to cater to both technical and non-technical users, ensuring that anyone can leverage AI capabilities without extensive coding knowledge.

An AI agent is an advanced AI system capable of performing complex tasks, making decisions, and interacting autonomously with minimal human intervention. While LLMs like GPT assist with conversations and tasks, they lack the ability to act independently. Lyzr Agent Studio bridges this gap by allowing users to build agents that can perform actions, retrieve information, and automate processes.

The essence of Lyzr Agent Studio is its Agent APIs.
